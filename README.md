C++ homework for data structures and algorithms

(100 pt) Problem:
Using good coding practices, make your own binary search tree data structure of integers that consider duplicates, 
where a parent node has a strictly greater value than left descents and smaller or equal value than right descents. 
Your tree data structure will contain classes BinarySearchTree and TreeNode and basic operations, including insert, 
erase, count, print, smallest. A sample main function is given on CCLE and the output is shown in Figure 1. 
Your code should also work for other test cases.
